## Roadmap

  - Explore the possibility of using alternative backends such as [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/)
    or [Actix](https://actix.rs/) as I have found myself preferring Rust.
  - Improve user experience with additional features such as:
      - Reading time
      - Speaking time
      - Paragraph count
      - Switch between light and dark mode
